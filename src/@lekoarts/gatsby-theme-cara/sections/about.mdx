## About

>I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer who works mostly in JavaScript, Python, Node.js, and React. However, I'm very inquisitive about other technologies I don't know and always look forward to expanding my knowledge.

Here's a few more facts about me. My background is in Electrical Engineering from ðŸŽ“ San Jose State University. I lived in Japan for 4 years and I speak Japanese ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ. I'm die-hard tech enthusiast who enjoys creating digital art through my Photography ðŸ“¸ and Videography ðŸŽ¥ in my spare time. 
But what I love even more is taking ideas and creating unique digital experiences with whatever tools best get the job done.

## About

>I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer who works mostly in JavaScript, Python, Node.js, and React. However, I'm very inquisitive about other technologies I don't know and always look forward to expanding my knowledge.📚 👨🏾‍💻 

My background is in Electrical Engineering from 🎓 SJSU. I lived in Japan 🇯🇵 for 4 years working as a UI/UX Design Engineer. It was a sink or swim situation so I taught myself to speak Japanese with no prior knowledge. I'm a quick learner and take great pride and find enjoyment in building things that wow 🤩!

My past life in Tech sales, molded me into an exceptional communicator with a natural ability to explain complex concepts simply. I may not have professional experience as a developer...yet. HOWEVER, what I lack in experience I make up for in tenacity and the ability to learn quickly 🚀. The projects on this site and my GitHub repo (@saizen408) serve as evidence that I possess the mental aptitude to rise to any challenge you might throw my way.

I'm looking for a team that's willing to give a guy courageous enough to follow his passion a chance. If you happen to be those individuals, you'll have a teammate who is consistently one of the hardest hustlers on your squad and will stop at nothing to accomplish the goals before him. 😤

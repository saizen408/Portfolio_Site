## About

>I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer who works mostly in JavaScript, Python, Node.js, and React. However, I'm very inquisitive about other technologies I don't know and always look forward to expanding my knowledge.📚 👨🏾‍💻

Here's a few more facts about me. My background is in Electrical Engineering from 🎓 San Jose State University. I lived in Japan for 4 years working as a UI/UX Design Engineer. Thanks to that wonderful experience, I taught myself to speak Japanese 🇯🇵. 

I'm a die-hard tech enthusiast who enjoys creating digital art through my Photography 📸 and Videography 🎥 in my spare time. 
But what I love even more is taking ideas and creating unique digital experiences with whatever tools best get the job done.

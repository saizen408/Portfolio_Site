# Hey there, I'm Eric Owusu!

 I'm a Polyglot Developer living in Portland, OR. who finds joy in creating ‚ú®spectacular‚ú® web experiences for the next generation of consumer-facing companies.  I have a background in Electrical Engineering and Sales bringing a unique perspective to web and software development! ‚úåüèæ 

I've built a broad variety of web applications and UI using React with Redux on top of custom APIs built with Node.js. I'm currently learning AWS Lambda, GraphQL and Python Django to expand my backend knowledge.
